THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED:
1*. Pawns  possibly being able to move out of their row as well *[pretty well tested at this point, this should be fine]
2. Pawns being able to capture pieces to the left and right of them on the board (both black and white have this issue)
3. Board not appearing immedaitly (one move is required for board to appear)
4. Board printing empty when an invalid move is done
